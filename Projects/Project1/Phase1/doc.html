		<h2>Development Notes</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, the implementation that I ended up using for phase one isn't really responsive at all.
			This is due to the 3-column layout that the main article has, wrapping around the image. I could get
			the paragraph to wrap around the image responsively just fine, but <em>nothing</em> I did would make
			the paragraph wrap around properly when in the 3-column mode. 
			<br>
			I floated the image (what I did originally),
			I used a grid, I moved the image around to different parts of the html and tried all sorts of things,
			but nothing would work except for absolutely positioning the image and manually inserting breaks into the
			text to make it wrap as intended.
			<br>
			I could have submitted it with the main article not in 3 columns but still wrapping around the image
			just fine, but since I tried so much to make the columns work I figured that even the janky method would have
			to do, as it represents the original page as close as I could get it.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Responsiveness Plan</h2>
		<img src="media/responsiveness-plan.png" alt="Page Responsiveness Diagram">
		<p>
			I plan to make this page function with a vertical layout at smaller screen sizes, and then at larger screen
			sizes float the image to the right so that the main article content wraps around it. This will function a little
			bit differently from the phase 1 implementation, as I needed to do some really strange things in order to make
			the layout and word wrapping fit properly with the 3-column text layout.
			<br>
			Changing the layout like this should be pretty easy when I don't need to worry about columnizing that content,
			as I've already done that before (at first, I didn't realize that text was split into columns).

	<h1>DM Screen++ Documentation</h1>
	<p>
		Overall, this project was me trying to apply my experience in other programming languages
		to JavaScript while just using the information from classes and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2><a href="index.html">The Site</a></h2>
	
	<h2>Resources Used</h2>
	<p>
		The only resources I used were the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>, 
		<a href="https://open5e.com/api-docs">Open5e API</a>, and prior classwork. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Cool Technical Stuff</h2>
	<p>
		With this project, the 'controls' aren't actually used on the search function. While searching is
		one of the controls on the website, the main controls are actually found on the monsters themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you add a monster to your combat queue, it has it's base HP and an empty initiative field. Users
		can fill these in with their own information and it will update in both of the places that the monster
		exists on the site. (the combat queue and the monster information section)
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent a lot of extra effort trying to make the controls update the entire site, and not just the
		place where you changed it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>
			Yes, whenever monster information is changed, almost all of the elements are swapped out.
			I was just too used to draw() calls to have it work a different way =P.
		</em>

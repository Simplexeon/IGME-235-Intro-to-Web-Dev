	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		This project was really fun to work on, and I definitely like it the most out of all of the projects
		I did for this class. I think it turned out really well, and I can add as many levels as I'd like to it!
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent a lot of time working on the UI, and making the game feel good to play. It ended up looking like
		a proper game, and I'm really proud of it.
		Of note my largest reference when designing the UI was the <em>Picross S</em> series of games. They have
		such good UI that it'd be a shame not to reference it. The most notable change I added is the error red
		color on the numbers. This usually appears when there are more filled tiles than there are numbers in the
		line.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also spent a lot of time on level design! I started getting a feel for it and didn't know how I 
		wanted to make the levels initially, but after making a couple of puzzles I started to get the hang
		of it. The last 4-5 puzzles are relatively hard and are pretty fun!
	</p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Dig Dug</strong> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. <br>
			Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around. <br>
			The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters <br>
			to the point where they explode. [...]
